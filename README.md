# MQTerminal
Android app used to control smarthome devices through Raspberry Pi. This project currently has a support for devices connected to the Raspberry Pi that are manually set in the code.

Planned features: Adding rooms and devices dynamically
                  Customize the layout of the app

I am also working on a python script for the Raspberry, so it can connect to the app and smarthome devices.
